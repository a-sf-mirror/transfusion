	BloodSource was a campaign launched in August 1999 by Greg "\frightfan/" Enright
	to obtain the source code of Blood from its owners. Initially, it was supposed to
	be used for 3DFX/OpenGL support, but as Greg pointed out:<br />
	<pre>
	Fixing the 3DFX patch is just the tip of the iceberg. Release of the
	source code would allow for great expansions of the game itself.
	</pre>
	The Blood source code was the only missing part, since the BUILD source code
	(the engine Blood used) was released by its creator, Ken Silverman. Even the
	Watcom C compiler is free now.<br />
	<br />
	During the campaign's lifetime, Greg obtained legal and technical information
	from various people, including officials from Monolith, 3D Realms and Infogrames,
	and Blood developers. <a href="http://www.saettler.com/">Matt Saettler</a>
	(Project Manager and Coder) and Nick Newhard (Game Designer) were particularly
	helpful in this quest and deserve a big thank.<br />
	<br />
	The BloodSource campaign gave birth to <a href="rebuild.php">the ReBUILD project</a>
	in August 2000, which in turn gave birth to the Transfusion Project in March 2001
	(known as qBlood at the beginning).<br />
	<br />
	Greg stopped his work for the BloodSource campaign in February 2001 and passed the reigns
	to Timothy Hale. Timothy announced the official end of the campaign in November 2001.<br />

	The following lines were written by Greg Enright for the BloodSource website. I had to
	edit them a bit though since the URL of the official Blood website has changed and all
	the relevant press releases have been removed from Monolith's website since then.<br />
