<div class="section">
	<h2 id="presentation-section" class="section">Presentation</h2>
	BloodSource was a campaign launched in August 1999 by Greg "\frightfan/" Enright
	to obtain the source code of Blood from its owners. Initially, it was supposed to
	be used for 3DFX/OpenGL support, but as Greg pointed out:<br />
	<pre>
	Fixing the 3DFX patch is just the tip of the iceberg. Release of the
	source code would allow for great expansions of the game itself.
	</pre>
	The Blood source code was the only missing part, since the BUILD source code
	(the engine Blood used) was released by its creator, Ken Silverman. Even the
	Watcom C compiler is free now.<br />
	<br />
	During the campaign's lifetime, Greg obtained <a href="#emails-section">legal</a>
	and <a href="rebuild.php#fileformats-section">technical</a> information
	from various people, including officials from Monolith, 3D Realms and Infogrames,
	and Blood developers. <a href="http://www.saettler.com/">Matt Saettler</a>
	(Project Manager and Coder) and Nick Newhard (Game Designer) were particularly
	helpful in this quest and deserve a big thank.<br />
	<br />
	The BloodSource campaign gave birth to <a href="rebuild.php">the ReBUILD project</a>
	in August 2000, which in turn gave birth to the Transfusion Project in March 2001
	(known as qBlood at the beginning).<br />
	<br />
	Greg stopped his work for the BloodSource campaign in February 2001 and passed the reins
	to Timothy Hale. Timothy announced the official end of the campaign in November 2001.<br />

	<h2 id="emails-section" class="section">Correspondence</h2>
	You'll find below the most interesting email exchanges that Greg and other people have had
	with the various parties involved regarding Blood source code and intellectual property.
	Only very minor editing changes were made compared to the original copy which was published on
	the BloodSource website. In particular, the text of every message remains untouched.<br />

	<br />
	<span class="boldtitle">Here is an email conversation between WKYA-Undertaker and GT
	Interactive Tech Support:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: May 25, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">WKYA-Undertaker:</span> Hello, I am a big fan of the Build Engine, I was wondering, if you could
	release the source code, or if you could give me Ken Silvermen's email addy? I know alot of
	people from Blood, Shadow Warrior, and Duke Nukem 3D that would love to have the source code.
	In fact, if you release the source code, there would be plenty of good mods for Duke 3D, and
	Shadow Warior, which means you would sell more copies of both of the games. If you release
	the source code, I will be making a Paint Ball type MOD for all of the Build games.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">GTI:</span> Our license for the engine prevents us from releasing the code.<br />
	As to Ken Silvermen's email address, I do not have access to it, nor permissionto send it out
	if I were to know it.[obviously Mr.Undertaker found it on his own] Sorry.<br />

	<span class="boldtitle">An email conversation between Frightfan and Joe Siegler of 3DRealms:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: August 13, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> I wish to know who I would talk to about the BUILD source code getting released (or not).
	Is it you?<br />
	Someone said "Scott Miller", but I don't know his email, and I found yours in the forum :)<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Joe Siegler:</span> There's really no one to talk to, because we're not releasing source code of any kind
	for Duke Nukem 3D, or the utilities.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> ok... why not?<br />
	The reason I ask is because there is a great deal of support for the idea of releasing the source
	code for BLOOD, from Monolith Productions. They used the BUILD engine, so they can't release the source
	code without BUILD's owner's approval.<br />
	Who owns BUILD?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Joe Siegler:</span> We own Build - and we're not interested in releasing any of it.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Does that mean that anyone who made a game using the BUILD engine can't release their source
	code?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Joe Siegler:</span> (No response yet.)<br />
	<br />

	<br />
	<span class="boldtitle">Ever persistent, Frightfan tries 3DRealms again :)</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: August 14, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Id Software owns Doom, DooM II, Quake, Quake II, but they released their codes.<br/>
	Monolith owns Blood 2, but they released their code.<br/>
	Valve owns Half-Life, but they released their code.<br/>
	... and each of those games continue to be popular amongst their fans because mod authors constantly
	breathe new life into those games.<br/>
	So, where's the harm?<br/>
	I dont understand... it can't be that much of a "hot property" anymore, can it?<br/>
	I can appreciate the value Duke Nukem holds for your company, but, it isn't really Duke Nukem's
	source that I am interested in ( although I am sure many others would be... )<br/>
	I just wanna know if Monolith can release Blood's source code... can you tell me that much? You see,
	they say they would do it, but want GTI to say that it's okay first. GTI, in turn, wants 3DR to say
	it's okay for them to *say* it's okay. Do you follow me?<br/>
	I sincerely don't want to be a pest... but I have a site where I am campaigning for the release of
	the Blood Source Code. If you check it out, you will see that there are many ppl interested in this
	happening. the address is - http://members.xoom.com/frightfan/blood_source - and please: sign the
	GuestBook. It would be great to have someone from one of the involved companies in there :)<br/>
	If you cannot tell me, could you point me in the direction of someone who could?<br/>

	<span class="boldtitle">An Email exchange between Frightfan and Jason Hall,CEO of Monolith Productions:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: August 18, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> I seem to have lost an email reply you sent me...<br />
	It was regarding Monolith's stance on releasing the Blood Source Code.<br />
	I am aware that 3DRealms owns the BUILD(more on that in the next message exchange, chers), which presents
	a problem for you in this matter. But what if they agreed to allow it? Would you actually release the
	source then?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Jason Hall:</span> GT Interactive controls the release of the Blood source.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Yeah, I know that, but you'd have to ask them, right? I mean, you'd be proposing it, right?<br />
	It's not like they're going to say "Hey, Jace, let's release the source code for Blood" anytime soon, is it?
	:)<br />
	All I really wanna know from you is this:<br />
	a) If GT said it would be ok, would you release the Blood-specific code?<br />
	b) If the owner/s of BUILD also said it would be ok, would you release the FULL source(blood AND build
	together)?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Jason Hall:</span> Answers:<br />
	a) Sure.<br />
	b) We have never had the BUILD source.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> I see.<br />
	a) So when you made Blood, you had the BUILD and that's it?<br />
	b) I thought Monolith made alterations to the BUILD for Blood - you couldn't have done that w/o the source,
	right?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Jason Hall:</span> Answers:<br />
	a) Yep. Just the .OBJ code<br />
	b) Ken Silverman made some changes. We also overrode some functions to do neat things too.<br />
	<br />

	<span class="boldtitle">An email conversation between Frightfan and Scott Miller, of 3DRealms:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: August 19th, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> I posted this on my site after exchanging a few emails with Joe Siegler on the possibility
	of getting the Blood Source Code released - since Blood was built on BUILD, I figured I had better talk
	to you guys about it, since you actually own that engine. So here is my argument...<br />
	----<br />
	[ see post from August 14th, 1999 to see what the argument was... ]<br />
	----<br />
	The reason I am sending you this, Mr. Miller, is that Mr.Siegler never wrote me back!! I have been
	waiting for a few days now. Is he gone on vacation, or did I somehow piss him off? If I did, I am sorry,
	but it seems like he misunderstood what I wanted from him. Now, for all I can tell, he is completely
	ignoring my email, and possibly not even glancing at it.<br />
	It's not like I am not a 3DRealms customer, either. As a purchaser of Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior, I
	expected that he could be a little more patient with me, but... well here I am.<br />
	Now, I do not intend to smear 3DR on my site, I want to make that clear.<br />
	I am looking for a way to get the source code of my favourite game released, and I have to talk to you
	guys about it. I think if you go to my site, you will find that nowhere does it say that 3DR is anything
	other than an important player in this campaign.<br />
	Now, I know I have said a mouthful, but could you just lemme know if you would allow Monolith to, in any
	capacity, release their source code for Blood?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Scott Miller:</span> The Build souce wasn't owned by us, it was licensed from the coder, Ken Silverman. He
	doesn't want to release it because he doesn't want to support it or be bothered with it, but it's 100%
	up to him to release it -- not 3DRealms.<br />
	As for the Blood source, that's Monolith's game and decision.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Okay, thank you very much for clearing that up!!!<br />
	Umm... you might want to inform Joe Siegler of those facts though - he told me, in no uncertain terms,
	that 3DRealms owned BUILD and that you guys were not in any way interested in releasing the source code.
	So... I am glad to hear that it isn't up to him! ;) jk<br />
	The whole reason I was talking about this Blood source stuff with 3DR(i always knew that Blood was not
	yours), was because Joe told me that 3DR owned the engine!<br />
	Now, for your opinion. Can Monolith/GT Interactive release the Blood source code without Ken's approval?
	If you'd rather not say, I'll understand. I intend to talk to Ken anyhow...<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Scott Miller:</span> They can release the Blood code that they wrote, but not the Build engine code without
	Ken's permission.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> I suppose that the BLOOD code would be mostly useless without it's engine code thought
	wouldn't it?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Scott Miller:</span> Correct, except for learning from.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Well thank you very much, Mr. Miller, for your time on this matter. I will post this
	conversation on my site today, and you will see your name on the credits page.<br />
	<br />

	<br />
	<span class="boldtitle">Here is my interview with Matt Saettler, Project Manager and Coder for Blood:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: Sept 16th, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> You said we would need the BUILD source to finish 3dfx's work on the patch. Does that
	mean that even if we don't use 3dfx's work as a base, we would actually need to modify the
	ENGINE itself? Forgive me if that sounds dumb, but I just wanna clear up any false hopes out
	there.<br />
	<br />
	I actually asked him this question TWO times, so I will print both responses:<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span><br />
	1) Build IS the engine.<br />
	3DFX took the engine (build) source and modified it to talk directly to their cards instead of
	using VGA display buffer.. They never finished the changes (there's bugs, it only supports Voodoo1,
	etc).<br />
	If you want Blood (or any Build game) to support 3DFX directly, then you'll need the Build (engine)
	source to be able to modify it (like 3DFX did),<br />
	2)If you don't want to update BUILD to support anything new (like 3DFX card directly), then you
	don't need the source. There's very few things that the source code would let you add. The best
	thing I can think of is making it a Windows-compatible engine (drawing to DIBs instead of VGA
	screen buffers), so that the games can run natively in Windows. (ditto for Linux, etc)<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> As for the 3DR utilities used in Blood, what do they do? Do we need them for everything?
	(you mentioned sound). Could we still "mod away" without them?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> I don't have the complete list in front of me.. There's the sound library for sure.
	You could not re-compile Blood ( nor Duke, NAM, or WW2GI ) without the object code to link to.
	So... No, you cannot "Mod away" without them.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> I am having alot of trouble contacting people regarding this campaign.<br />
	- Ken Silverman, for one<br />
	- ANYONE at GT Interactive, for another.<br />
	- Scott Miller, at 3dRealms. He used to reply to me within the hour.... wonder what happened?<br />
	Are you able to get these ppl's attention better than I, by any chance?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> I talked with Scott via email a couple of months ago about releasing WW2GI source
	and he was concerned about supporting it, among other things. Maybe that will change as time goes on.<br />
	The people I knew at GT have left. GT's staff has been pretty decimated by their lay-offs and
	lagging sales, etc.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Could you explain .OBJ code for those of us who don't know why we need *it*, and not the
	whole engine?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> Source code compiles into .OBJ code (A .CPP file is compiled into .OBJ). The .OBJ
	code is combined in a process called Linking into an .EXE file (or a .DLL) that is the actual
	executable. In addition, a group of compiled .OBJ files can be combined into a Library (.LIB file).
	Most published interfaces are distributed as .LIB files. In Windows, .LIB files can also contain
	the references into the .DLL file for the application to use.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Do you know Claudia Schiffer's ph#?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> I'm sure the Ken Silverman has it.... I think he put it into the BUILD source code
	as a comment.... :) <br />
	<br />

	<br />
	<span class="boldtitle">Great news from Scott Miller of, President of 3DRealms:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: Sept 25th, 1999</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Matt Seattler, Project Manager and Coder for Blood, says:<br/>
	IN ADDITION, you need permission from 3D Realms/Apogee for some of their utility libraries (sound).
	These are used in both Blood and DukeNukem.<br/>
	So, it would seem that our conversations on Blood are not over:) I hope you don't mind me coming
	after you all the time about a game that isn't even YOURS.... :)<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="title">Scott Miller:</span> Permission granted. :)<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Thank you very much, the Blood fans love you for it:)<br/>
	I am not sure what these shared utilities ARE exactly, but how do we go about getting/using them.
	Forgive my ignorance in this matter. I am just a guy who makes websites and a Blood fan, I know
	nothing about programming...<br/>
	So, if you wouldn't mind telling me... can we use these utilities NOW? Or do we have to wait for
	the source code release to make any use of them?<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="title">Scott Miller:</span> [ still awaiting reply ]<br />

	<span class="boldtitle">More from Matt Saettler:</span><br />
	<br />
	<i>Date: July 10th, 2000</i><br/>
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span>  Now that we have the BUILD source, is it possible to create a Win32 Blood
	without the Blood specific code?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> It's possible for somebody to create a Windows version of Build. I'd talk
	to 3D Realms about making a Duke port to see if they'd be interested.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> What would it solve to make a WinBUILD? That alone wouldn't equal WinBlood,
	or Win(insert BUILD game title here) would it?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> Somebody is already trying. Saw message on the EDuke forum. (or was it
	3D Realms's BUild forum?) One of those. That wouldn't equal WinBlood or WinDuke, But it should
	make it possible given the game source.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> Should we wait until GT is persuaded to release the entire Blood source code?<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> Don't know about the Blood source from lith. I doubt they'll release it.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> [Jason Hall] already said he would if it were up to him, but it isn't - it's
	GTI's game now.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Matt Saettler:</span> Jace is wrong. I'm the one that negotiated the contracts. Jace probably
	doesn't even know what's really in them....<br />
	<br />
	<span class="title">Frightfan:</span> So, if I may assume: Monolith can just go ahead and release the source without any
	permission from GT?? Because I really believe that would change everything.<br />
