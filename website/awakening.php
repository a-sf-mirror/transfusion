	Transfusion II: Caleb's Awakening should be our next project. Its development is currently
	frozen because of a lack of coders.<br />
	Unlike Transfusion, Caleb's Awakening is based on the Quake 2 engine. The main goal is to remake
	the single player part of Blood, althought we will surely provide the same multiplayer modes than
	those available in Transfusion.<br />
