	Transfusion II: Caleb's Awakening is our next project. Its development has just started so you
	shouldn't expect a nice playable version until months.<br />
	Unlike Transfusion, Caleb's Awakening is based on the Quake 2 engine, and our priority is to remake
	the single player part of Blood this time. Don't worry though, we will also provide the same
	multiplayer modes than those available in Transfusion.<br />
