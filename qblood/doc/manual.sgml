   <!-- Introduction -->

   <sect><heading>Introduction<p>
      The qBlood Project aims to recreate an old DOS game from Monolith
      Productions called Blood, using the Quake engine. Although qBlood will switch
      to the Quake 2 engine soon, we have decided to release our current work under
      the name "BloodBath".

      It looks like a simple <it>mod</it>, but actually you don't need Quake data
      to run it. Indeed, BloodBath is a complete total conversion of the
      multiplayer aspect of Blood. The original Blood is a remarkable game, and
      the qBlood team hopes you'll have as much fun playing it as we had playing
      Blood.

      Obviously, you'll be more at ease if you already know Blood and/or Quake.
      But even if it's not the case, don't worry: you should be able to find in
      this manual all you have to know about BloodBath.

   <!-- Installation -->

   <sect><heading>Installation<p>
      Those of you that are already familiar with Quake shouldn't have any
      difficulties for installing BloodBath. Like with any mod, all you have
      to do is to put all BloodBath PAK files in a subdirectory of Quake (naming
      it "bb" is highly recommended), and then launch the game with "quake
      -game bb" if your Quake binary is "quake.exe" and BloodBath directory is
      "bb".

      Note that BloodBath supports both classic Quake (also known as NetQuake
      or NQ) and QuakeWorld (QW). Installing BloodBath for QW will require the
      same "bb" directory than NQ, but you'll also need to add a bunch of files
      and subdirectories in the "qw" directory if you don't have the Quake data
      or if you want to all BloodBath graphics as soon you launch the QW client.
      These files are present into the BloodBath distribution under the "qw"
      subdirectory.

   <!-- Basic usage -->

   <sect><heading> Basic usage<p>
      <sect1>Game types<p>
         BloodBath supports 3 game types:
         <itemize>
            <item> BloodBath / DeathMatch (deathmatch not 2, and teamplay = 0)<p>
            <item> Team BloodBath (deathmatch not 2, and teamplay not 0). If you
            set teamplay to 2, team members can damage each other.<p>
            <item> Capture The Flag (deathmatch = 2). As with TBB,
            setting teamplay to 2 activates friendly fire.<p>
         </itemize>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>Impulses<p>
         Let's start with the impulse list:
         <itemize>
            <item> impulses 1 to 9, and impulse 17: select a weapon<p>
            <item> impulses 10 and 11: cycle to next/previous weapon<p>
            <item> impulse 12: secondary fire (equivalent to the "+use" command)<p>
            <item> impulse 13: use the currently selected item<p>
            <item> impulses 14 and 15: select previous/next item<p>
            <item> impulse 16: view the current value of the next armor type<p>
            <item> impulse 20: become an observer (only allowed when dead)<p>
            <item> impulse 50: enter the <ref id="voting menu" name="voting menu"><p>
            <item> impulse 100: add a bot (to the red team if available)<p>
            <item> impulse 101: add a bot (to the blue team if available)<p>
            <item> impulse 102: kick a bot<p>
            <item> impulse 141: identify the player you're aiming at<p>
         </itemize>

         All those impulses are considered cheats (not available in multiplayer
         games, except if the server has the "sv_allowCheat" cvar set to a
         non-zero value). <em>WARNING</em>: due to strict resource management,
         some of them MAY CRASH THE GAME if the required sounds and models are
         not precached at this moment.
         <itemize>
            <item> impulse 103: botcam mode (NQ only)<p>
            <item> impulse 104: waypoint edit mode (NQ only)<p>
            <item> impulse 250: Dump all entities stats to console (debug)<p>
            <item> impulse 251: Give full armor<p>
            <item> impulse 252: Burn yourself !<p>
            <item> impulse 253: Give all inventory items<p>
            <item> impulse 254: Put you on the <ref id="BOD" name="Brink Of Death"><p>
            <item> impulse 255: Give <ref id="Akimbo" name="Guns Akimbo"><p>
         </itemize>
      </sect1>
   </sect>

   <!-- Weapons -->

   <sect><heading>Weapons<p>
      You have 12 differents weapons at your disposal in BloodBath. Each of them
      but one has a normal fire and a secondary fire, also known as altfire.
      Most of the time, it's a deadlier mode that consumes more ammo.
      <descrip>
         <tag>Pitch Fork</tag> Your starting weapon. Deadly. No altfire mode.
         <tag>Flare Gun</tag> ...
         <tag>Shotgun</tag> No description is needed I think. Altfire makes you
         fire both shells.
         <tag>Tommy Gun</tag> The machinegun you've surely already seen in old
         gangster movies. The altfire moves your gun horizontaly while
         firing.
         <tag>Napalm Launcher</tag> A kind of rocket launcher, except that it
         throws napalm balls. The alftire mode is a surprise...
         <tag>TNT / Proximity Bombs / Remote Detonators</tag> ...
         <tag>Spray Can</tag> A kind of flame-thrower. Cans make good replacements
         for TNT in altfire mode.
         <tag>Tesla Cannon</tag> Capable of throwing electric jolts at a very
         high rate, the tesla cannon is a feared weapon. Its altfire mode
         delivers an huge (and explosive) electric jolt.
         <tag>Life Leech</tag> This powerful magical weapon can be used either
         as a spiritual ball launcher, or as a sentry in altfire mode. The leech
         never runs out of ammo: it has unlimited ammo in sentry mode, and if it
         has no more soul to consume in normal mode, it will steal your life to
         fuel itself!
         <tag>Voodoo Doll</tag> This magical weapon causes spiritual damage to
         your opponent. But beware: miss him and you'll be the one who will
         take the pain! The altfire consumes all your ammo in one powerful
         spiritual blow.

   </sect>

   <!-- Items -->

   <sect><heading>Items &amp; Powerups<p>
      Here is the (incomplete) list:
      <descrip>
         <tag>Boots of Jumping</tag> When activated, double your jump height.
         <tag>Cloak of Shadows</tag> Makes you invisible (except the eyes)
         <tag>Diving Suit</tag> ...
         <tag>Doctor's Bag</tag> When activated, give you back enough life
         points to put you at 100. Can be used several times (the bag can give
         back a total of 100 HP).
         <tag>Guns akimbo<label id="Akimbo"></tag> If you have enough ammo,
         gives you a copy of your current weapon in your left hand. Lasts 30
         secondes. Don't work with the fork, the spray can and the voodoo doll.
         <tag>Reflective Shots</tag> All damages done to you by bullets are
         inflicted to the attacker instead.
      </descrip>
   </sect>

   <!-- Brink Of Death -->

   <sect><heading>Brink Of Death<label id="BOD"><p>
      When a player's HP reaches between 1 and -1, he is on the brink of death,
      but not dead (yet). If nobody finishes him, he will be able to come back
      to life after 15 seconds, at 1 HP.

      A player can't put himself on the BOD. It also doesn't apply to someone
      who's on fire.
   </sect>

   <!-- Voting menu -->

   <sect><heading>Voting menu<label id="voting menu"><p>
      The voting menu is a mecanism that allows players to change server
      settings via votes. For the moment, the available settings are: map, game
      type, frag limit and time limit.

      To enter the menu, you must use "impulse 50" while idle. The menu is
      entirely based on impulse commands. To enter into a submenu or vote for
      something, just send the impulse number corresponding to your choice.
      Once you have voted, you will be exited from the menu automatically, but
      until you vote or you explicitely exit the menu, all your impulses will
      be handled by it.

      Observers don't have access to the menu.
   </sect>

   <!-- Cvars -->

   <sect><heading>Cvars<p>
      You'll find in BloodBath quite a lot of the usual cvars from Quake. We
      have already talked about "deathmatch", "teamplay", "fraglimit" and
      "timelimit"; but you'll also find "skill" for setting the bots skill.

      BloodBath has a few specific cvars that you may want to use:
     <itemize>
        <item> "g_weaponStay": if set, weapons don't disappear when taken, but
        you can't take a weapon more than once<p>
        <item> "sv_allowCheat": enable a few more client impulses, which may be
        used to CHEAT one way or another, and MAY CRASH THE GAME under some
        conditions. You have been warned.<p>
        <item> "sv_disable": a set of flags that allow a server administrator
        to keep his server under control despite the voting system. Its value
        must be set by adding the following numbers: 1 to disable bots, 2 to
        disable map voting, 4 to disable game type voting, 8 to disable frag
        limit voting, 16 to disable time limit voting, and 32 to disable options
        voting. For example, setting "sv_disable" to 5 (1+4) will ensure your
        server won't have bots and won't change its initial game type.<p>
     </itemize>
     Your server must have a "set" command, or an automatic cvar creation at
     progs request, to allow you to use the new cvars though. It's not the case
     of the original Quake binaries and of quite a lot of more modern versions
     of the Quake engine. Be sure to check that.

   <!-- FAQ -->

   <sect> <heading> Frequently Asked Questions <p>
      <descrip>
         <tag>I can't spawn bots (server is full) / nobody can join my NQ server</tag>
         You may have forgotten to put "-listen 8" or more in Quake's command line
         ("-dedicated 8" for a dedicated server). By default, Quake allows only 1
         client into the game. That's why you must explicitely start a multiplayer
         game with the menu or add a "-listen" or "-dedicated" argument to your
         command line to tell Quake you want more clients.

         <tag>Quake exits with: <em>Z_Malloc: failed on allocation of XXX bytes</em></tag>
         The engine hasn't allocated enough "zone" memory. You can change this
         with the "-zone" command line argument. With most engines, "-zone 256"
         will be enough, but some of them may require more (try 512).

         <tag>I want to contribute to the qBlood Project. How can I do ?</tag>
         It's very simple. Start doing a quick tour through our 2 websites to
         be sure to know all the basic informations you may need. Then, contact
         the Project Coordinator and either the Lead Artist or the Lead
