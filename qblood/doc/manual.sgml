   <!-- Introduction -->

   <sect> <heading> Introduction <p>
      The qBlood Project aims to recreate an old DOS game from Monolith
      Productions called Blood, using the Quake engine. Although qBlood is
      still just a <it>mod</it>, we plan to make it an independant game. The
      original Blood is a remarkable game, and the qBlood team hopes you'll
      have as much fun playing it as you would have playing Blood.

      Obviously, you'll be more at ease if you already know Blood, or Quake.
      But even if it's not the case, don't worry: this manual will tell you all
      you have to know about qBlood.

   <!-- Installation -->

   <sect> <heading> Installation <p>
      Before you start qBlood installation, you'll need a working Quake
      installation. Which means a Quake compatible binary, either an official
      Quake binary or one of the enhanced versions that were created since its
      source code release; you will also need the Quake game data, <tt>pak0.pak
      </tt> and <tt>pak1.pak</tt> in the <tt>id1</tt> subdirectory. Note that
      qBlood supports both classic Quake (also known as NetQuake or NQ) and
      QuakeWorld (QW), although NQ is the only way to play single player games.

   <!-- Basic usage -->

   <sect><heading> Basic usage<p>
      <sect1>Game types<p>
         QBlood supports 5 game types:
         <itemize>
            <item> Single player game (deathmatch = 0, and coop = 0)<p>
            <item> Cooperative game (deathmatch = 0, and coop = 1)<p>
            <item> BloodBath / DeathMatch (deathmatch = 1, and teamplay = 0)<p>
            <item> Team BloodBath (deathmatch = 1, and teamplay not 0). If you
            set teamplay to 2, team members can damage each other.<p>
            <item> Capture The Flag (deathmatch = 2). This game type can't be
            set via the interface. You need to use the console. As with TBB,
            setting teamplay to 2 activates friendly fire.<p>
         </itemize>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>Impulses<p>
         Let's start with the impulse list:
         <itemize>
            <item> impulses 1 to 9: select a weapon<p>
            <item> impulses 10 and 11: cycle to next/previous weapon<p>
            <item> impulse 12: secondary fire<p>
            <item> impulse 13: use the currently selected item<p>
            <item> impulses 14 and 15: select previous/next item<p>
            <item> impulse 16: view the current value of the next armor type<p>
            <item> impulse 100: add a bot (to the red team if available)<p>
            <item> impulse 101: add a bot (to the blue team if available)<p>
            <item> impulse 102: kick a bot<p>
            <item> impulse 103: botcam mode<p>
            <item> impulse 104: waypoint edit mode<p>
            <item> impulse 141: identify the player you're aiming at<p>
         </itemize>

         All last impulses are considered cheats (not available in multiplayer
         games, except if the server has the "sv_allowCheat" cvar set to a
         non-zero value). <em>WARNING</em>: due to strict resource management,
         using these impulses may crash the game if the requiered sounds and
         models are not precached at this moment.
         <itemize>
            <item> impulse 250: Dump all entities stats to console (debug)<p>
            <item> impulse 251: Give full armor<p>
            <item> impulse 252: Burn yourself !<p>
            <item> impulse 253: Give all inventory items<p>
            <item> impulse 254: Give all weapons, ammos, and keys<p>
            <item> impulse 255: Give <ref id="Akimbo" name="Guns Akimbo"><p>
         </itemize>

   <!-- Weapons -->

   <sect><heading>Weapons<p>
      You have 12 differents weapons at your disposal in qBlood. Each of them
      but one has a normal fire and a secondary fire, also known as altfire.
      Most of the time, it's a deadlier mode that consumes more ammo.
      <descrip>
         <tag>Pitch Fork</tag> your starting weapon. Deadly. No altfire mode.
         <tag>Flare Gun</tag> ...
         <tag>Shotgun</tag> no description needed I think. Altfire makes you
         fire both shells.
         <tag>Tommy Gun</tag> the machinegun you've surely already seen in old
         gangster movies. The altfire moves your gun horizontaly while
         firing.
         <tag>Napalm Launcher</tag> a kind of rocket launcher, except that it
         throws napalm balls. The alftire mode is a surprise...
         <tag>TNT / Proximity Bombs / Remote Detonators</tag> ...
         <tag>Spray Can</tag> ...
         <tag>Tesla Cannon</tag> ...
         <tag>Voodoo Doll</tag> this magical weapon causes spiritual damage to
         your opponent. But beware: miss him and you'll be the one who will
         take the pain! The altfire consumes all your ammo in one powerful
         spiritual blow.
         <tag>Life Leech</tag> (not yet implemented)

         secondes.

   <!-- FAQ -->

   <sect> <heading> Frequently Asked Questions <p>
      <descrip>
         <tag>Quake exits with: <em>Z_Malloc: failed on allocation of XXX bytes</em></tag>
         QBlood seems to use quite a lot of zone memory, so you may need to
         increase its size with the "-zone" argument. I personnally use "-zone
         256".

         <tag>Boots of jumping doesn't work / I jump higher in NQ than in QW</tag>
         NQ relies on the game code to handle jumping, but QW does it in its
		 own code. As a result, we can't tweak the jump velocity in QW until
		 we get our own version of the Quake engine.

         <tag>I want to contribute to qBlood. How can I do ?</tag>
         It's very simple. Start doing a quick tour through our 2 websites to
         be sure to know all the basic informations you may need. Then, contact
         the Project Coordinator and either the Lead Artist or the Lead
         Programmer, depending on what you want to contribute.
