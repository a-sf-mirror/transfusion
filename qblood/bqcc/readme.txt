Bloody QCC is a modified version of meQCC (Mr Elusive's QuakeC Compiler) v1.4.
Along with a bug fix that now allows macro parameters to have parenthesis,
BQCC can be used with the "-qw" parameter. Under this mode, BQCC uses the
"qwprogs.src" file instead of "progs.src", and automatically defines
"QUAKEWORLD".

For other informations, take a look at "qcc.txt" and "meqcc.txt", included
into this package.
