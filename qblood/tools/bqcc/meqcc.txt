Description
-----------

This is a modification to the Quake-C compiler from id-Software. It allows
for creating a progs.dat which cannot be decompiled to Quake-C source code.
As an added bonus a progs.dat which cannot be decompiled is a lot smaller.
The compiler also has a C compatible precompiler. A description of the
precompiler directives can be found in a regular C manual.
There are two additional precompiler directives:

$evalint(statement)       evaluates statement to an integer
$evalfloat(statement)     evaluates statement to a floating point number

The statement may not contain Quake-C variables.

Example:

#define FL_1     1
#define FL_2     2
#define FL_3     4
#define FL_4     8
flags = $evalint(FL_1|FL_2|FL_3|FL_4);

the precompiler will create the following Quake-C source code:

flags = 15;

NOTE: the defines and macros are NOT global like the QuakeC source. If you
want to use certain defines and/or macros in all the source files you can
put them on the command-line. You can also put them in a file and include
this file in every QuakeC file. For instance create 'settings.h' with the
defines and/or macros and add '#include "settings.h"' at the top of every
QuakeC file.


Usage
-----

MEQCC.EXE looks for a progs.src in the current directory.
The easy way to use the compiler is to copy it to the directory with
the source code and execute it from there.

Command line options:

-src <directory>  look for a progs.src in the specified directory
-undec            create progs.dat which cannot be decompiled
-undec+           " and write out undec.txt
-asm <function>   output Quake ASM code of the specified function
-d <define>       add a preprocessor definition
-?                display command line options
-h                "
-help             "

Example:

meqcc -src e:\quakec\mebot -undec+ -d "BOT 1" -d "ABS(x) (x < 0 ? -x : x)"

The source files listed in e:\quakec\mebot\progs.src will be compiled
into a progs.dat which cannot be decompiled. Also the following precompiler
definitions will be added:

#define BOT     1
#define ABS(x)  (x < 0 ? -x : x)
